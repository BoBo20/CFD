From a methodological point of view, CFD can
be divided into the following three categories:
	
	1.Microscopic: 	MD (Molecular Dynamics)
	
	2.Mesoscopic: 	LBM (Lattice Boltzmann Method)
			DSMC (Direct Simulation Monte Carlo)
			GKS (Gas Kinetic Scheme)
			UGKS (Unified Gas Kinetic Scheme)
			DUGKS (Discrete Unified Gas Kinetic Scheme)

	3.Macroscopic:	N-S Equation Based Method

In one hand, Molecular dynamics methods are currently limited to simulations 
of simple flow conditions due to the tremendous computation. In another hand,
N-S equation is no longer correct in rarefied flows. DUGKS is based on the 
Boltzmann equation, which is appropriate for flow simulation from continuum
flow to free-molecular flow (all kndsen number).It seems like this kind of
methods will have a very promising future.
